# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning (Jupyter Notebook)

This project demonstrates the use of machine learning classification algorithms to predict diabetes based on patient medical data.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Models Implemented
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

## Steps Performed
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature scaling
- Model training and evaluation

## Output
Model performance evaluated using accuracy score and confusion matrix.

## How to Run
Open the notebook and run all cells:
```bash
jupyter notebook diabetes_prediction.ipynb
